## Features

- **Ease of Use:** No complicated procedures - just upload your video, set a start time and GIF duration, then hit download. Voil√†!
- **Browser-Based Convenience:** No need for installations or setups. GIF-IT! works entirely in your browser, utilizing your system's computing power. 

## How to Use

2. Upload your desired video.
3. Set your preferred start time and GIF duration.
4. Hit the "Create GIF" button and watch the magic happen!

## System Requirements

Since GIF-IT! is browser-based, the main requirement is a modern web browser (latest version of Chrome or Firefox recommended). Please note that the application is currently set up to be single-threaded, due to updates in Chromium that have affected multi-threading capabilities for the FFMPEG WASM package.
